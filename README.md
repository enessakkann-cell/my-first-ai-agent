# My First AI Agent 🧠

This project is my first step into AI automation.  
The goal is to build an **AI Agent** that helps analyze weekly production data from a textile company and automatically generates a report.

## 🎯 Objective
- Read production data from a file
- Summarize and analyze performance using AI (e.g., Claude or ChatGPT)
- Create an automatic weekly report

## 🧩 Technologies
- n8n (workflow automation)
- Claude / OpenAI API (LLM)
- Google Drive / Docs (storage & output)

## 🚀 Roadmap
1. Set up project structure ✅  
2. Build first n8n workflow (reading file & summarizing data)  
3. Connect to Claude API for natural language reporting  
4. Offer as service to local SMEs
